<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Probability is the study of chance. Many learners struggle because they rush
        to formulas without understanding what is happening. This chapter focuses on
        understanding situations first, then calculating slowly and correctly.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- BASIC CONCEPTS -->
<section>
    <h2>Basic Probability Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> An action with an uncertain result</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A possible result</li>
        <li><strong>Sample space:</strong> All possible outcomes</li>
        <li><strong>Event:</strong> One or more outcomes</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- BASIC FORMULA -->
<section>
    <h2>Basic Probability Formula</h2>
    <p>
        Probability of an event is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p><strong>P(Event) = Number of favourable outcomes ÷ Total number of outcomes</strong></p>

    <h3>Worked Example 1 (Very Slow)</h3>
    <p><strong>A fair die is rolled. Find the probability of getting a 3.</strong></p>

    <p>Step 1: List all possible outcomes</p>
    <p>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</p>

    <p>Step 2: Identify favourable outcomes</p>
    <p>{3}</p>

    <p>Step 3: Apply the formula</p>
    <p>P(3) = 1 ÷ 6</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> P(3) = 1/6</p>
</section>

<!-- COMPLEMENTARY EVENTS -->
<section>
    <h2>Complementary Events</h2>
    <p>
        The complement of an event A is the event that A does NOT happen.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> P(A) + P(A′) = 1</p>

    <h3>Worked Example 2</h3>
    <p><strong>If P(A) = 0.35, find P(A′).</strong></p>

    <p>Step 1: Use the rule</p>
    <p>P(A′) = 1 − P(A)</p>

    <p>Step 2: Substitute</p>
    <p>P(A′) = 1 − 0.35 = 0.65</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> P(A′) = 0.65</p>
</section>

<!-- MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE -->
<section>
    <h2>Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
    <p>
        Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</p>

    <h3>Worked Example 3</h3>
    <p>
        A card is drawn from a standard deck.
        Find the probability of drawing a heart or a spade.
    </p>

    <p>Step 1: Total number of cards = 52</p>
    <p>Step 2: Number of hearts = 13</p>
    <p>Step 3: Number of spades = 13</p>

    <p>Step 4: Apply formula</p>
    <p>P = (13 + 13) ÷ 52 = 26 ÷ 52</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> P = 1/2</p>
</section>

<!-- NON-MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE -->
<section>
    <h2>Non-Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>
    <p>
        These events CAN happen at the same time.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A and B)</p>

    <h3>Worked Example 4</h3>
    <p>
        In a class, 18 learners take Mathematics, 12 take Physics,
        and 5 take both. The class has 30 learners.
        Find the probability that a learner takes Mathematics or Physics.
    </p>

    <p>Step 1: Write the formula</p>
    <p>P(A or B) = (18 + 12 − 5) ÷ 30</p>

    <p>Step 2: Simplify</p>
    <p>P = 25 ÷ 30 = 5/6</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> P = 5/6</p>
</section>

<!-- TREE DIAGRAMS -->
<section>
    <h2>Tree Diagrams</h2>
    <p>
        Tree diagrams help when events happen one after another.
    </p>

    <h3>Worked Example 5</h3>
    <p>
        A bag has 3 red balls and 2 blue balls.
        One ball is drawn, replaced, then another is drawn.
        Find the probability of drawing two red balls.
    </p>

    <p>Step 1: Probability of red on first draw = 3/5</p>
    <p>Step 2: Because the ball is replaced, probability remains 3/5</p>

    <p>Step 3: Multiply probabilities</p>
    <p>P = (3/5) × (3/5) = 9/25</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> P = 9/25</p>
</section>
