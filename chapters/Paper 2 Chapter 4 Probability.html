    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Probability measures the **likelihood of events** occurring.  
        In Paper 2, learners focus on **both theoretical and experimental probability**, including **combined events, independent and dependent events**.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Basic Probability Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1</li>
        <li>P(S) = 1, where S is the sample space</li>
        <li>P(A') = 1 − P(A), probability of complement</li>
        <li>For mutually exclusive events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Combined Events</h2>
    <p>Probability of two events occurring together (intersection):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Independent events: P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)</li>
        <li>Dependent events: P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Worked Example 1 – Independent Events</h3>
    <p>Two dice are rolled. Find probability of both showing 6.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>P(6 on die 1) = 1/6, P(6 on die 2) = 1/6</li>
        <li>P(both) = 1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Worked Example 2 – Dependent Events</h3>
    <p>Two cards drawn without replacement. Find probability both are aces.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>P(first ace) = 4/52</li>
        <li>P(second ace) = 3/51</li>
        <li>P(both) = 4/52 × 3/51 = 12/2652 = 1/221</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Complementary Probability</h2>
    <p>Probability that an event does not occur: P(A') = 1 − P(A)</p>

    <h3>Worked Example 3</h3>
    <p>A bag has 5 red and 3 blue balls. Find probability of not drawing a red ball.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Total balls = 5 + 3 = 8</li>
        <li>P(red) = 5/8</li>
        <li>P(not red) = 1 − 5/8 = 3/8</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conditional Probability</h2>
    <p>P(A|B) = Probability of A given B has occurred</p>

    <h3>Worked Example 4</h3>
    <p>In a deck of 52 cards, find probability that a card is a king given it is a face card.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Total face cards = 12</li>
        <li>Number of kings = 4</li>
        <li>P(King | Face card) = 4/12 = 1/3</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A coin is tossed twice. Find probability of two heads.</li>
        <li>Find probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck.</li>
        <li>Two balls drawn with replacement: probability both are white.</li>
        <li>Find probability of not rolling a 4 on a die.</li>
        <li>Conditional probability: probability that a student is female given that they are in Grade 12 (use hypothetical numbers).</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Probability ranges from 0 to 1</li>
        <li>Complement: P(A') = 1 − P(A)</li>
        <li>Independent vs dependent events differ in calculation</li>
        <li>Conditional probability helps in dependent scenarios</li>
        <li>Step-by-step reasoning avoids errors</li>
    </ul>
